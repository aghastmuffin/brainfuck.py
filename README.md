any bugs that are present will not be fixed by me!
with that out of the way, lets begin. First, download the pre-compiled .exe
(or compile it using [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller), [cx_freeze](https://github.com/marcelotduarte/cx_Freeze), or [Nukita]("https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka")!
